- Impact on scoring: Higher relative advantage increases innovation score

**Compatibility**
- How well the innovation fits with existing values, experiences, and needs
- Measurement: Integration complexity, learning curve, cultural fit
- Impact on scoring: Better compatibility enhances adoption potential and overall score

**Complexity**
- The degree of difficulty in understanding and using the innovation
- Measurement: User interface complexity, technical requirements, implementation difficulty
- Impact on scoring: Lower complexity generally correlates with higher adoption potential

**Trialability**
- The extent to which an innovation can be experimented with on a limited basis
- Measurement: Pilot program feasibility, demonstration capability, risk assessment
- Impact on scoring: Higher trialability reduces adoption barriers and increases score

**Observability**

## Evaluation Methodology

### 1. Scoring Algorithm Theory

#### Multi-Dimensional Scoring Framework
The evaluation system employs a weighted multi-dimensional scoring approach based on established psychometric principles:

**Innovation Score Calculation**:
```
Innovation Score = (Technical Innovation × 0.4) + (Market Innovation × 0.3) + (User Impact × 0.3)
```

**Rationale**: Technical innovation receives the highest weight as it represents the core differentiating factor, while market innovation and user impact provide contextual validation.

**Novelty Score Calculation**:
```
Novelty Score = (Technical Novelty × 0.5) + (Application Novelty × 0.5)
```

**Rationale**: Equal weighting between technical and application novelty ensures balanced assessment of both methodological and contextual innovation.

**Overall Score Calculation**:
```
Overall Score = (Innovation Score × 0.6) + (Novelty Score × 0.4)
```

**Rationale**: Innovation receives higher weight as it encompasses broader impact potential, while novelty provides essential differentiation assessment.

APEX Judge: An Agentic AI Framework for Comprehensive Project Evaluation Using Multi-Modal Context and Small Language Models

The Project Evaluator MCP Server provides AI-powered evaluation of projects, code, and ideas. It combines the Model Context Protocol (MCP) powered by Perplexity AI with a custom-trained Small Language Model (SLM) for problem-solution relevance analysis.

Features:

1. Innovation & Novelty Evaluation – Assess individual projects, run batch checks, or compare projects with detailed scoring and recommendations.

2. Code Evaluation – Analyze code repositories for quality, maintainability, security, and scalability.

3. Patentability Check – Estimate novelty and potential for patentability, with insights into prior art risks.

4. Problem-Solution Fit (Custom SLM) – Evaluate how relevant a solution is to a given problem, returning results such as Highly Relevant, Relevant, Less Relevant, or Irrelevant.

How It Works:

MCP + Perplexity → Handles innovation, code, and patentability evaluations.

Custom SLM → Handles problem-solution fit evaluations.
